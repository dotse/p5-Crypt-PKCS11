=head1 NAME

Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::AttributeArray - An array of Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute objects as an PKCS #11 attribute.

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  # Create an attribute module with an array of Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute objects
  package Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::WrapTemplate;
  use base qw(Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::AttributeArray);
  use Crypt::PKCS11 qw(:constant);
  sub type () { CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE }

  # Use the attribute
  my $attribute = Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::WrapTemplate->new;
  $attribute->push(
      Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::Token->new->set(1)
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A PKCS #11 attribute containing an array of Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute objects.

This module is similar to `Crypt::PKCS11::Attributes` but is specially used to
contain attributes within attributes.

=head1 METHODS

See also `Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute` for the base module methods.

=over 4

=item $attributeArray = $attributeArray->push (...)

Appends all arguments to the container, will croak unless each argument is a
`Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute`. Returns itself on success.

=item $attribute = $attributeArray->pop

Removes and returns the last attribute in the container or undef if there are
none.

=item $attribute = $attributeArray->shift

Removes and returns the first attribute in the container or undef if there are
none.

=item $attributeArray = $attributeArray->unshift (...)

Prepends all arguments to the container, will croak unless each argument is a
`Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute`. Returns itself on success.

=item $attributeArray = $attributeArray->foreach ($cb)

For each attribute in the container, call the given callback and supply it with
the attribute. Will croak if no callback is given and returns itself on success.

=item $array_ref = $attributeArray->toArray

Convert the container to an array reference in the format needed for the XS
calls, see `TEMPLATE ARGUMENT` in `Crypt::PKCS11::XS`. Croaks on error.

=item $attributeArray = $attributeArray->set (@attributes)

Set the array of Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute objects for the attribute from the
list of arguments. May croak on error and returns itself on success.

=over 4

=item @bytes

A list of Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute objects.

=back

=item $pValue = $attributeArray->pValue

Overloads the default pValue call and returns an array references as decribed in
the `toArray` call.
