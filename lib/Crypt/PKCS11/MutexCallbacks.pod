Crypt::PKCS11 - Mutex Callbacks

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  TODO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PKCS #11 supports setting callbacks for handling mutex and in the C library they
can be set per loaded PKCS #11 library but there is no context pointer supplied
to the C callback functions so there is no portable way to related to the
relevant Perl callbacks and therefor all these callbacks are global. Setting
them once will affect all loaded PKCS #11 libraries.

=head1 CALLBACKS

=item DestroyMutex ($mutexID)

A callback to a function to use for destroying mutex objects.
