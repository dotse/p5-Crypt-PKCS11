Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute - Base for PKCS #11 attributes (CKA)

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  package Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::Class;
  use base qw(Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::CK_ULONG);
  use Crypt::PKCS11 qw(:constant);
  sub type () { CKA_CLASS }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base module for all attribute in Crypt::PKCS11. Should not be used
directly, see L<Crypt::PKCS11::Attributes> for all available attributes.

=head1 BASE ATTRIBUTE VALUES

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $attribute = Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute->new (...)

Return a new attribute object, if any arguments are passed while creating then
they are passed to $attribute->set(...) before returning. The object created is
a blessed hash reference.

=item $cka_type = $attribute->type

This sub must be overloaded!

Return the CKA type of the attribute.

=item $pValue = $attribute->pValue

Return the raw value stored within the attribute, since all attribute objects
are blessed hashes this will be $self->{pValue}.

=item $attribute = $attribute->set (...)

This sub must be overloaded!

Set the value of the attribute. Must croak on error and return itself ($self) on
success.

=item <...> = $attribute->get

This sub must be overloaded!

Return the value of the attribute or undef if no value is set. Can croak on
error.
