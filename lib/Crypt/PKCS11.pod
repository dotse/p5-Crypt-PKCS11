=head1 DESCRIPTION

Crypt::PKCS11 provides a full-fedged PKCS #11 v2.30 interface for Perl and
together with a PKCS #11 proivder .so library you can use all the functionallity
a Hardware Security Module (HSM) has to offer from within Perl.

Other modules/pod sections included are:

=over 4

=item Crypt::PKCS11::XS

XS layer containing wrappers for all PKCS #11 functions that converts Perl data
structures to/from PKCS #11 specific data structures.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Session

A module handling everything related to a PKCS #11 session.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Object

A module that represent a PKCS #11 object which for example can be a public or
private key.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute

A module that represent a PKCS #11 attribute that are used in templates when for
example creating keys. This is only a base class, see
`Crypt::PKCS11::Attributes` for a list of all available attribute.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attributes

A module to handle a set of Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute objects and also lists all
available PKCS #11 attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::constant

List of all PKCS #11 constants.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::AttributeArray

A base module that handles nested PKCS #11 attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::ByteArray

A base module that handles byte array attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::CK_BBOOL

A base module that handles boolean attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::CK_BYTE

A base module that handles one byte attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::CK_DATE

A base module that handles date attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::CK_ULONG

A base module that handles an unsigned long attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::RFC2279string

A base module that handles RFC 2279 string attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::UlongArray

A base module that handles unsigned long array attributes.

=item Crypt::PKCS11::Attribute::Value

A base module that handles attributes containing either a byte array or a binary
string.

=head1 TESTING

This module has been tested with the following PKCS #11 providers:
- SoftHSM version 1
- SoftHSM version 2

This module has been tested on the following operating systems:
- Ubuntu Server 12.04.4

=head1 RETURN VALUES AND ERROR HANDLING

This is the general return value and error handling for all methods unless
otherwise stated.

On XS layer errors, when called from within these methods, all methods returns
false (0/undef) and the XS layer error can be retrieved with `$pkcs11->errno`
for the number and `$pkcs11->errstr` for the message.

For errors from the methods themself, the method will confess (croak) with the
error message.

=head1 CONSTANTS

All PKCS #11 constants (C #define's) can be imported by specifying the tag
:constant when using the module, see TODO for a list of all constants.

  use Crypt::PKCS11 qw(:constant);

There are also hashes for reverse lookup available, to get the name of the
constant in text, per constant section using the tag :constant_names, for
example if you wish to reverse lookup a mechanism you can use the `%CKM_NAME`
hash.

  use Crypt::PKCS11 qw(:constant_names);
  ...
  print "Support for $CKM_NAME{$mechanism} found.\n";

Beside all constants that exists in PCKS #11 v2.30 these have been added:

=over 4

=item CK_ULONG_SIZE

Contains the size of CK_ULONG type that will be different depending on the
operating system.

=head1 METHODS

For more extensive documentation about the methods, data structures and types
please see http://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v230/ .

=over 4

=item $pkcs11 = Crypt::PKCS11->new

=item $pkcs11->load ($so)

=item $pkcs11->unload

the object.

=item $pkcs11->Initialize ([initArgs => ... ])

Initialize the PKCS #11 library, this must be done before using the PKCS #11
library. The initialization arguments can be given as one hash reference or as

support for individual callbacks per Crypt::PKCS11 object.

All of the Mutex arguments needs to be set if any should be used.
